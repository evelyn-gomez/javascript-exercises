# Exercise 09 - Palindromes

Write a function that determines whether or not a given string is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a string that is spelled the same both forwards and backwards, usually without considering punctuation or word breaks:

### some palindromes:
  - A car, a man, a maraca.
  - Rats live on no evil star.
  - Lid off a daffodil.
  - Animal loots foliated detail of stool lamina.
  - A nut for a jar of tuna.

```javascript
palindromes('racecar') // true
palindromes('tacos') // false
```


### self-reflection 
This took alot longer than expected, regarding using regex I did find the solution for using a regex on stackoverflow, conceptually I know what I need to do within a few minutes. Solved most of the problem, had a hard time figuring out how to remove whitespaces and nonAlphabet characters.
