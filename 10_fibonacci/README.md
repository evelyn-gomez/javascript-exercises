# Exercise 10 - Fibonacci

Create a function that returns a specific member of the Fibonacci sequence:

> A series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.

```javascript
fibonacci(4) // returns the 4th member of the series: 3  (1, 1, 2, 3)
fibonacci(6) // returns 8
```
## Reflection 
  My initial thought is I could use array.reduce() 
  I still think think it be more cleaner if I go that route, but since it did take me a bit longer than expected, I decided to
  just keep my current solution.
